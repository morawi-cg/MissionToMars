# <p>Mo Rawi Mission to Mars</p>
<p>This is a simple software based concpetualization of a Mars space launch vehicle. A scenario was presented.</p>
<p>It has each stage of the launch vehicle described within a class like software presentation, the total number of stages are 3.</p> 
<p>Each was given in a different programming language. An extra fexibility was offered to the participants in the technical challenge.</p> 
<p>This flexibility allows participants to change the language to a more preferred language.</p>
 
<p>Each stage was read & analyzed to derive the software functionality for a software class or likewise object</p>
<p>Diagraming was used as software's success in presenting a solution will depend on the correct visualization of functions and flows.</p>
