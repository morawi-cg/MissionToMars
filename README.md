# <p>Mo Rawi Mission to Mars</p>
<p>This software a conceptualization of a Mars space launch vehicle.</p>
<p>It has 3 stages launch vehicle described, each described within a package, the total number of stages are 3.</p>
<p>Dependencies for packages are in the form of databases, mysql/mariadb for the booster package. mongodb for the cargo package.   
<p>Each package was given is based upon a different programming language</p> 
<p>Each stage package is to be run from a within a docker based container, locally tested using docker file, then docker-compose to connect together</p>
<p>Kompose the kubernetes based is used to translate docker compose based YAML files into the Kubernetes alternative services and deployments.</p>


### Reasearch into the programming languages forming individual components was conducted to understand the functions.

## Project story road map stages:
- [1] Copy this folder into 'amaze-us/microservice/challenge-3'.
- [2] Initiate the 'CodeSourceDestMover.sh' script, this will copy relevent component source to desired location for the docker-compose to activate build.
- [3] initiate 'docker-compose up' this will process the 'docker-compose.yaml' file, it will complete steps below.
- [4] Build the container for the 'todoapp-db'. Always DB first then the app component that needs it.
- [5] Build  'booseter Go container', located in __MoRawi-MoissionToMars__/Booster.
- [6] Build stage2 container,(based upon python2.7).
- [7] Build mongo-db based container, (using docker-compose), named the folder cargo-db.
- [8] Build cargo,(node-js), based container, test dependencies,(using docker-compose).
- [9] A each components (container can be build individualy with docker-compose file or the Docker file kept in the spcecific container folder.
- [10] After test/validation is complete with success, try to translate to kuberneted based files using kompose, assuming Kubernetes is the target choice.
- [11] Ensure you have selected the version of kompose suitable for the Operating system you will use to process this code, defacto here is Linux.
- [12] Obtain kompose by 'curl -L https://github.com/kubernetes/kompose/releases/download/v1.20.0/kompose-linux-amd64 -o kompose'
- [13] Run kompose 'convert -f docker-compose.yaml'
- [14] Translate the successful services to Kubernetes portable units using Kompose..
- [15] Test all to ensure they work as required.
- [16] Created 'kubernetes-based-services' folder which hosts the translated services I made from running kompose 


### Test & Debug, tips and ideas: [Booster]
A tool called delve came handy, a link is left below:
```
go get -u github.com/go-delve/delve/cmd/dlv
```
Trying to test with dlv will reveal issues with code via the debug flag
testing the binary 'booster' done via the link below:
```
curl 127.0.0.1:3000/?users=booster
```

### Mysql [Booster dependency]

A good way to pass the db-create script through mysql-prompt:
```
   mysql -u root -e"set @temp=1; `cat $PATHTOMYSQLSCRIPT/mysql_config_linux.sql`"

```

### Extra Testing & Dependencies:
Some testing was implemented on vms, this was to understand the software functionality, solving dependency & better understanding the way in which porting to containers should be done.

Packages such as Node-JS based ones & Golang based ones , needed extas dependencies installed on the hosting vms, this was handled through the discovery & teting process, aimed at the software functionality:

```

  ├── bson@1.1.3

  └── sliced@1.0.1 


```

### Docker compose 
To bring up the components using a docker compose command. Each folder for each stage unit had a docker compose file to allow for unit test. A central docker compose file is available to run the entire collection of services.

```

 docker-compose up    # -d flag might follow the up to make it run in the background

```
To stop

``` 
 docker-compose stop <service name> 
 # The specific service name would be arrived at from the docker-compose file 

```
To start specific service 

```
 docker-compose start <service name>

```

To delete service 

```
 docker-compose rm -f <service name>

```


To run a command on a container, used for testing

```
 docker-compose run <service name > command # command could be ls

```
To scale

```
 docker-compose scale <service name>=<number> 

```
